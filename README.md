# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 (done mostly in 2022)

* **Day 1** (Python): Read through a list of numbers, and find two
  (then three) that add up to 2020 (*easy*)
* **Day 2** (Python): Read each line, and validate password against 
  character-count rules (*easy*)
* **Day 3** (Python): Count up the number of '#' encountered when traversing
  an array with a given dx/dy slope for each step. The rows wrap if x 
  coordinate is wider than the data (*easy*).
* **Day 4** (Python): Simple validation of semi-structured text "passports",
  first looking for missing fields, then checking field contents against some
  simple rules (*easy*).

To compile and run a Go program
* Change into the directory with the program
* go build day02.go
* ./day02

To run a Julia program
* Change into the directory with the program
* julia day02.jl

And of course, to run a Python program
* Change into the directory with the program
* python day06.py
